Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   954 out of  44,800    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 954
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        953 out of  44,800    2%
    Number used as logic:                      953 out of  44,800    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             942
      Number using O5 and O6:                   11

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   339 out of  11,200    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,238
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           284 out of   1,238   22%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 285 out of   1,238   23%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         669 out of   1,238   54%
    Number of unique control sets:              40
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of  44,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       241 out of     640   37%

    Number using BlockRAM only:                  8
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              14
    Total Memory used (KB):                    252 out of   5,328    4%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
