1. Develop software routines for addition, multiplication and extended Euclid’s algorithm (finding multiplicative inverse) in GF(2^8) with irreducible polynomial defined as f(x) =x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1.
2. Show examples for extended Euclid’s algorithm and multiplication (e.g. for multiplication find primitive polynomial(s)/generator(s) for discussed GF(2^8)).
3. Measure the performance of your routines in terms of clock cycles for 2 different processor configurations:
MB, external SDRAM memory, no cache
MB, external SDRAM memory, cache 64KB
