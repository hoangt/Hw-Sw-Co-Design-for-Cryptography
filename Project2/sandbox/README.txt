This tutorial guides you first through the process of adding a timer/counter component to the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) project and using it for simple profiling of a software application.
In the second part you will add additional timer/counter and interrupt controller and write a software application that utilizes both timers. In this part of the lab you will be using Software Development Kit (SDK) for development of software application and SDK Debugger to set break points and view the content of variables and memory.
- Modify hardware project by adding/removing existing Intellectual Property (IP) components
- Use hardware timer/counter to profile software application
- Utilize the XPS timers with interrupt controller
- Assign an interrupt handler to the timer
- Develop an interrupt handler function
- Use SDK debugger for software development
