This tutorial guides you through the process of using Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) to create hardware and software for an FPGA based system-on-chip. You will utilize the soft core MicroBlaze processor module that will be synthesized using the logic resources within the FPGA device.
? Create hardware and software projects using XPS
? Use Base System Builder (BSB) to configure a system targeting the Xilinx ML507 board
? Configure linker script and build software project
? Download the test software and verify its functionality.
